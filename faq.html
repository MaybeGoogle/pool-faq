        	Monero is a secure, private, and untraceable cryptocurrency. It is open-source and accessible to all.

        <p layout-padding ng-show="q_gulf">
		We recommend using "gulf.moneroocean.stream" for all cases because 1) it will direct you to the closest server with the lowest
                latency (and this is the most important thing to consider) and 2) it will automatically redirect your miner to other server if the nearest
                one goes down for some reason. Using specific gateway nodes like "de.moneroocean.stream", "us.moneroocean.stream" and
		"jp.moneroocean.stream" make sense only in very, very specific cases that likely do not apply to you.

		No malware will be installed. Setup scripts will try to install the latest stock binaries of

		(for example you have old version of Linux or antivirus removed them) it will try privately compiled versions of xmrig
		that have better compatibility with old version of Linux (for example CentOS 6) and are not detected by know antivirus software.
		Script will also try to configure miner to run in low priority mode so it will not affect usual programs
		and setup miner to be activated after reboot. Setup scripts have quite verbose output and will comment every single step they are doing.

        <a href="" ng-click="q_waves=!q_waves">Why does my hashrate on the dashboard fluctuate?</a>
        <p layout-padding ng-show="q_waves">
		It is normal for waves to have amplitude within 20% of your average hashrate.
		Hashrate fluctuations on the dashboard happen because the pool doesn't know your exact miner hashrate,
		but derives it from rate of its submitted results, that can fluctuate based on your miner luck.
		Usually the more miners you have the less their overall fluctuation will be (unless they are hidden behind xmr-node-proxy,
		in which case hashrate fluctuations will behave like one miner).

		Yes, you can place worker name after wallet address (after . character like this: ".&lt;worker name&gt;").
		Also it is possible (and actually a more common way) to place worket name in your miner password,
		like this "&lt;worker name&gt;:&lt;pool password&gt;", where :&lt;pool password&gt; part is optional,
		but needed if you want to set a pool UI password you can use to login your wallet options on the mining pool website.

        <p layout-padding ng-show="q_ban_addr">
		If we get enough evidence that some wallet address on the pool is used for malware/botnet activities then we will block this address
		from further mining. By enough evidence we mean at least several reports from different sources. And by blocking the address we mean that 
		miners that try to use this address will be rejected. We do not plan to freeze already mined funds (total due), so they can be retrieved
		by setting lower threshold in Dashboard Options. If you think you can be accused of this we strongly recommend setting your dashboard
		password to a valid email address, so we will have a chance to contact you after first such report and you will have ability
		to set your threshold in case of wallet address block later.

		benefit from. During this transition to a proxy, your miners will be reconnected to a pool and all your miner hashrate stats will
		be joined under single "proxy" miner. It still make sense to run your own xmr-node-proxy server for better control of your miners.

		PPLNS reward system means that you will receive less than normal reward share until you mine longer than PPLNS window size.
		In addition, you will receive rewards for blocks after you stopped mining as long as your hashes are still in PPLNS window of these blocks.

		Ban happens if your miner does not submit shares for like 2 minutes after connection.
		To make this happen you should put not only high diff but also make it fixed so pool does not have a chance to lower it using
		auto diff (and auto diff does not have enough time to adjust too high initial port difficulty).
		Basically it is also protection for mistakes on your side too because mining with too high fixed diff usually

		Despite the fact thet all ports will set fixed difficulty to 400000 if they detect nicehash miner it is still recommended to select port

		Any XMR proxy servers make sense to use only if you have more than 10 miners.
		Because of this pool architecture, the only recommended XMR proxy server is xmr-node-proxy.
		Usage of other proxy servers will cause almost no positive effect on pool load and will be internally proxied anyway
		if it will make sense from pool load balancer point of view.

		Congratulations! This means that your total mining speed is high enough and you do not use xmr-node-proxy to decrease it on your own,

		You can not track individual miner progress anymore on website.
		If you want more control over your miners please setup xmr-node-proxy on your own.

		Loading hashrate data from a large amount of miners slows down pool API so that is why as preventive measure pool can
		limit maximum number of reported miners to 50 (per payment address). That does not mean that not reported miner hashrate is lost -
		you just can not track their hashrate on website separately and they are reported as single "all_other_workers" miner.

		Pool uses share accumulation technique to allow it to be scaled well and do not crash in case of high volume of low difficulty shares.
		It works this way: your shares are merged into one until all of these conditions hold true:

		<md-list>
			<md-list-item><span><md-icon md-font-set="material-icons">star</md-icon>&emsp;
				less than one minute passed since last share merge;
			</span></md-list-item>
			<md-list-item><span><md-icon md-font-set="material-icons">star</md-icon>&emsp;
				current block template not changed;
			</span></md-list-item>
			<md-list-item><span><md-icon md-font-set="material-icons">star</md-icon>&emsp;
				accumulated share difficulty does not exceed 1000000 (one million) hashes;
			</span></md-list-item>
		</md-list>

		So basically you can consider that your shares are merged into one every minute.
		Share merge should not affect reward caclulations in any significant way and it does not benefit any particulair group of miners.
